Introduction

The Howdy app is a versatile social platform created for iOS devices. Its primary goal is to bring people together by providing a space to:

    Share content, including images, videos, and text updates.
    Connect with others by following their profiles and exploring shared interests.
    Stay up-to-date with real-time notifications.
    Enjoy a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

The app is split into two components: the Howdy app for viewing and interacting with content, and the Howdy Upload app for content creation and submission. This division allows for a seamless user experience while maintaining the integrity of the platform.
